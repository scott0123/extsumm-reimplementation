the short - term periodicities of the daily sunspot area fluctuations from august 1923 to october 1933 are discussed . for these data the correlative analysis indicates negative correlation for the periodicity of about @xmath0 days , but the power spectrum analysis indicates a statistically significant peak in this time interval . a new method of the diagnosis of an echo - effect in spectrum is proposed and it is stated that the 155-day periodicity is a harmonic of the periodicities from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] days .    the autocorrelation functions for the daily sunspot area fluctuations and for the fluctuations of the one rotation time interval in the northern hemisphere , separately for the whole solar cycle 16 and for the maximum activity period of this cycle do not show differences , especially in the interval of @xmath2 $ ] days . it proves against the thesis of the existence of strong positive fluctuations of the about @xmath0-day interval in the maximum activity period of the solar cycle 16 in the northern hemisphere . however , a similar analysis for data from the southern hemisphere indicates that there is the periodicity of about @xmath0 days in sunspot area data in the maximum activity period of the cycle 16 only .
