in the hierarchical search for periodic sources of gravitational waves , the candidate selection , in the incoherent step , can be performed with hough transform procedures . in this paper we analyze the problem of sensitivity loss due to discretization of the parameters space vs computing cost , comparing the properties of the sky hough procedure with those of a new frequency hough , which is based on a transformation from the _ time - observed frequency _ plane to the _ source frequency - spin down _ plane . results on simulated peakmaps suggest various advantages in favor of the use of the frequency hough . the ones which show up to really make the difference are 1 ) the possibility to enhance the frequency resolution without relevantly affecting the computing cost . this reduces the digitization effects ; 2 ) the excess of candidates due to local disturbances in some places of the sky map . they do not affect the new analysis because each map is constructed for only one position in the sky . + pacs . numbers : 04.80nn,07.05kf,97.60jd
