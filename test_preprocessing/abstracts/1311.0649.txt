kingman s coalescent is a random tree that arises from classical population genetic models such as the moran model . the individuals alive in these models correspond to the leaves in the tree and the following two laws of large numbers concerning the structure of the tree - top are well - known : ( i ) the ( shortest ) distance , denoted by @xmath0 , from the tree - top to the level when there are @xmath1 lines in the tree satisfies @xmath2 almost surely ; ( ii ) at time @xmath0 , the population is naturally partitioned in exactly @xmath1 families where individuals belong to the same family if they have a common ancestor at time @xmath0 in the past . if @xmath3 denotes the size of the @xmath4th family , then @xmath5 almost surely . for both laws of large numbers we prove corresponding large deviations results . for ( i ) , the rate of the large deviations is @xmath1 and we can give the rate function explicitly . for ( ii ) , the rate is @xmath1 for downwards deviations and @xmath6 for upwards deviations . for both cases we give the exact rate function . =     =    =     =
