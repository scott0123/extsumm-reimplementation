we present a phenomenological study of the single - transverse spin asymmetry in azimuthal correlations of two jets produced nearly `` back - to - back '' in @xmath0 collisions at rhic . we properly take into account the initial- and final - state interactions of partons that can generate this asymmetry in qcd hard - scattering . using distribution functions fitted to the existing single - spin data , we make predictions for various weighted single - spin asymmetries in dijet correlations that are now readily testable at rhic .
