we study the detectability of circular polarization in a stochastic gravitational wave background from various sources such as supermassive black hole binaries , cosmic strings , and inflation in the early universe with pulsar timing arrays . we calculate generalized overlap reduction functions for the circularly polarized stochastic gravitational wave background . we find that the circular polarization can not be detected for an isotropic background . however , there is a chance to observe the circular polarization for an anisotropic gravitational wave background . we also show how to separate polarized gravitational waves from unpolarized gravitational waves .
