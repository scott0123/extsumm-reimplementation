we study a novel class of numerical integrators , the adapted nested force - gradient schemes , used within the molecular dynamics step of the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm . we test these methods in the schwinger model on the lattice , a well known benchmark problem . we derive the analytical basis of nested force - gradient type methods and demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach , namely reduced computational costs compared with other numerical integration schemes in hmc .
