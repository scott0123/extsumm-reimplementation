i summarize what we have learned about the nature of stars that ultimately explode as core - collapse supernovae from the examination of images taken prior to the explosion . by registering pre - supernova and post - supernova images , usually taken at high resolution using either space - based optical detectors , or ground - based infrared detectors equipped with laser guide star adaptive optics systems , nearly three dozen core - collapse supernovae have now had the properties of their progenitor stars either directly measured or ( more commonly ) constrained by establishing upper limits on their luminosities . these studies enable direct comparison with stellar evolution models that , in turn , permit estimates of the progenitor stars physical characteristics to be made . i review progenitor characteristics ( or constraints ) inferred from this work for each of the major core - collapse supernova types ( ii - plateau , ii - linear , iib , iin , ib / c ) , with a particular focus on the analytical techniques used and the processes through which conclusions have been drawn . brief discussion of a few individual events is also provided , including sn 2005gl , a type iin supernova that is shown to have had an extremely luminous  and thus very massive  progenitor that exploded shortly after a violent , luminous blue variable - like eruption phase , contrary to standard theoretical predictions .
