starting from the wkb approximation , a new barrier penetration formula is proposed for potential barriers containing a long - range coulomb interaction . this formula is especially proper for the barrier penetration with penetration energy much lower than the coulomb barrier . the penetrabilities calculated from the new formula agree well with the results from the wkb method . as a first attempt , this new formula is used to evaluate @xmath0 decay half - lives of atomic nuclei and a good agreement with the experiment is obtained .
