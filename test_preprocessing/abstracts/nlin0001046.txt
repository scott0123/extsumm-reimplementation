we discuss several novel types of multi - component ( temporal and spatial ) envelope solitary waves that appear in fiber and waveguide nonlinear optics . in particular , we describe multi - channel solitary waves in bit - parallel - wavelength fiber transmission systems for high performance computer networks , multi - colour parametric spatial solitary waves due to cascaded nonlinearities of quadratic materials , and quasiperiodic envelope solitons due to quasi - phase - matching in fibonacci optical superlattices .    2
